# Autofill Jobs ðŸš€

A browser extension to automatically fill in job applications, rebuilt for smarter and faster use.

This project is a significant evolution of an earlier autofill extension, completely overhauled with intelligent answer management, a modern UI, and broader site compatibility.

## Key Enhancements in This Version

*   **Intelligent Answer Clustering**: Instead of just saving one-to-one answers, this version is smarter. It clusters similar questions (like *"Why this role?"* and *"What makes you a good fit?"*) together. When you update your answer for one, it becomes the new go-to answer for that entire topic.

*   **Context-Aware Suggestions**: The extension finds your most relevant saved answer by understanding the *meaning* of the new question on a form, not just by matching keywords. On sites with very strict security policies, it gracefully falls back to a simple word-overlap matching algorithm to ensure you still get helpful suggestions.

*   **Automatic Resume Parsing**: With a Google Gemini API key, it reads your resume to auto-populate your skills and work experience, saving you manual data entry.

*   **Modern & Usable UI**: The user interface has been completely redesigned with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS for a clean, intuitive experience.

*   **Expanded Site Support**: Now works reliably on more job boards, including Ashby, Greenhouse, and Workday.

## Supported Platforms

*   Greenhouse
*   Lever
*   Workday
*   Dover
*   Ashby
